Thoughts on Stuff and Junk?

This is just my piece of the big-scary-web where I pontificate on stuff, and junk. Not that everything I write about is junk…. it’s well, just a funny name.

Books. Day-to-day gear. Productivity systems. We’re all looking for the best of them.

Here’s where I opine about those things and hopefully help suss out the best of them.

Thanks for visiting!

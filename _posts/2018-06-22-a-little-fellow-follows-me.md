A careful man I want to be,<br>
A little fellow follows me;<br>
I do not dare go astray,<br>
For fear he’ll go the self-same way.<br>
I cannot once escape his eyes,<br>
Whate’er he sees me do, he tries;<br>
Like me he says he’s going to be,<br>
The little chap who follows me.<br>
He thinks that I am good and fine,<br>
Believes in every word of mine;<br>
The base in me he must not see,<br>
The little chap who follows me.<br>
I must remember as I go,<br>
Through summer’s sun and winter’s snow;<br>
I’m building for the years to be<br>
That little chap who follows me.<br>
